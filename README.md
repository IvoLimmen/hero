# Adventure game

A small adventure game just to play with the mechanics.

# Issues

- Parsing is not great. Stuff can not have spaces.
- Argument parsing is done on each command that requires them.
- Line parsing has auto-complete but does not handle arguments.

# Todo

- Generate the entire spacestation using a list of existing location (in JSON) by simply connecting them
- Move texts to a separate content file (?)
- Maybe split the World file as the logic gets really big
- Add more items and uses
